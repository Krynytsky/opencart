# OPENCART. Testing project

Before starting your local tests, make sure you change the opencart navigation URL that responds to your localhost settings.
You can change the URL in  src/main/java/com/opencart/enums/URLs. 
Use TeamLocalURLs Helper class.

To create system variables in the project in the main folder you need to create a package (resources),
add a file called aplicatin.properties, enter your data in this file
( for example:  "email = your email address")
( for example:  "password = your password")
