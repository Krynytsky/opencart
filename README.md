# OPENCART. Testing project

Before starting your local tests, make sure you change the opencart navigation URL that responds to your localhost settings.
You can change the URL in  src/main/java/com/opencart/enums/URLs. 
Use TeamLocalURLs Helper class.

To create system variables in the project, you need to add them to the file aplicatin.properties 
that are in the resource package (for example "email = test@gmail.com")
